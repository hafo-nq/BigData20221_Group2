Occupying a pivotal role in Great Power rivalries and in the international drug trade, Kyrgyzstan has felt the effects of the disintegration of the former Soviet Union more dramatically than any other post-Soviet state. Just five years ago, the Kyrgyz \u00c2\u201cTulip Revolution\u00c2\u201d was hailed as a peaceful readjustment of a post-Soviet country, once acknowledged as one of the only \u00c2\u201cdemocratic\u00c2\u201d regimes of Central Asia in the 1990s. But the Tulip Revolution was soon betrayed, and under Kurmanbek Bakiev and his \"family regime,\" Kyrgyzstan descended into authoritarianism. The film chronicles the popular revolt that led to the toppling of president Bakiev and his clan in April 2010, and the ever-deepening chaos into which the country plunged in its aftermath, culminating with the large-scale inter-ethnic violence in June 2010. The lack of power and legitimacy of the interim government, with its own family network and clan-based divisions, have prevented it from stabilizing the country politically, economically, and socially. All this is documented through interviews with several top officials, and \u00c2\u201cpeople on the street.\u00c2\u201d From Bishkek to the southern cities of Jalal-Abad and Osh, over the breath-taking highway uniting North and South through the Tian-Shan mountain range, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Russians, Meshketian Turks, and other ethnic minorities share their anger, frustrations, and hopes. In an interview in his Moscow exile, Askar Akaev, the first president of independent Kyrgyzstan, himself toppled during the Tulip Revolution, gives his own version of history and current events.", "Language": "Russian, Kyrgyz", "Country": "Canada, Russia, Kyrgyzstan", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRkYTM3ODUtZmM2ZC00MjNiLTg4ZjUtYzZhMzYyNjhkNmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzg5OTk2OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "N/A", "imdbVotes": "N/A", "imdbID": "tt1734156", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
