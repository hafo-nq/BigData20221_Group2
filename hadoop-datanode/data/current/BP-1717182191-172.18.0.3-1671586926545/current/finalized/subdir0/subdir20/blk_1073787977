Hidden deep in the hills, around 350 people live in handmade huts. In The Source we experience a day in Hetea. The film starts with long, static shots of the beginning of a new morning. A pastoral way of life takes off: guiding cows and horses, getting water, building a new wooden house, doing the washing etc. In the afternoon suddenly the fat is in the fire. People scream and threaten each other. Little by little the serene atmosphere returns, but while the sun is going down the aftereffects of the quarrel are still audible. \r\n", "Language": "Romanian", "Country": "Netherlands", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "N/A", "Ratings": [], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "N/A", "imdbVotes": "N/A", "imdbID": "tt1440337", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
